Codes used to generate tables and figures are saved in a separate R script file under the folder analysis_code, file name exploratorycodeR.R

Please note while i was able to create tables and figurs in the R script file, The figures are showing as an array of numbers between 0 and 1 . i havent figured out why yet. So the right figures may not pull into the quarto file
