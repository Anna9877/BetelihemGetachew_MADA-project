# Introduction

## General Background Information

For countries like Botswana, and other African countries the prevalence
of smoking is relatively low compared to other middle and high income
countries. However, while the smoking prevalence might be low, not much
has been said about smokers nicotine dependence in the region.
Understanding nicotine dependence among smokers provides an opportunity
for a targeted intervention strategies that are more efficient and
effective.

Under the Global Tobacco Surveillance system Data (GTSSData) at CDC, the
Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) is the global standard to
systematically monitor adult tobacco use and track key tobacco control
indicators. The survey is a nationally representative household survey
of adults 15 years of age or older, using a standard protocol. It is
intended to generate comparable data within and across countries. GATS
enhances countries' capacity to design, implement and evaluate tobacco
control interventions ([GATS Botswana Survey
2017](https://nccd.cdc.gov/GTSSDataSurveyResources/Ancillary/DataReports.aspx?CAID=2&Survey=4&WHORegion=3&Country=123&Site=27000)).
Using GATS protocol, a nationally representative sample of 4,643
participants was collected in Botswana in 2017 using a stratified
cluster sample design.

The aim of this paper is therefor to;

1.  Describe the prevalence of nicotine dependence in Botswana using the
    Heavy Smoking Index(HSI) by Socio-demographics and other factors

2.  Explore and Identify predictors of nicotine dependence in Botswana.

# Methods

*Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning
processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a
shorter description here and all the details in the supplement.*

This study will conduct a secondary data analysis using the Global Adult
Tobacco Survey (GATS) Botswana as described above. The survey data
collection was completed in 2017. The sample design is a multi-stage,
geographically clustered probability sample design to produce nationally
representative data. First, households are randomly selected, then one
individual is randomly chosen from each selected household to
participate in the survey. The random selection of households and
participants allows for an unbiased, randomly selected, and nationally
representative sample of the larger population. The cluster sampling
allows representation in gender and urbanicity. More details on the
Global Adult Tobacco Survey implementation process can be found
elsewhere ([GATS Implementation
Protocol](https://nccd.cdc.gov/GTSSDataSurveyResources/Ancillary/Documentation.aspx?SUID=4&DOCT=4)).

A total of 608 variables covering topics of socio-demographic, tobacco
smoking, smokeless tobacco, cessation both smoking and smokeless,
economics, media and knowledge, attitude and perceptions of tobacco were
collected in this survey. While the outcome measure of interest
"Nicotine dependence" is not directly collected, the measure for
nicotine dependence, also known as the Heavy Smoking Index (HSI), will
be calculated as a score using two question items from the tobacco
smoking section on the survey questionnaire ([Heaviness of Smoking Index
\| Data Share 2.0
(nih.gov)](https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/instrument/heaviness-of-smoking-index).
Based on the HSI scores, smokers will be categorized into low addiction
(score 0-2), medium addiction (score 3-4), high addiction (5-6).

## Data import and cleaning

An SPSS data file was [downloaded from GTSS Info
website](https://nccd.cdc.gov/GTSSDataSurveyResources/Ancillary/DataReports.aspx?CAID=2&Survey=4&WHORegion=3&Country=123&Site=27000)
and imported into R. The code for importing and cleaning the dataset is
documented in the R script file titled "processingcode.R". The raw
dataset contained 4643 observations and 608 variables, of which 591
variables were filtered out. Only 17 variables were considered for
further examination.The variables of interest included
socio-demographics, smoking status, smoking behaviors, cessation and
media exposure. The 18th variable was computed by summing two variables
(B01 + B07) to create the Heavy Smoking Index (HSI) Score, a proxy for
examining nicotine dependence. The number of observations was further
reduced by including only daily and less than daily smokers leaving a
total of 631 observations. The dataset was examined for outliers,
distribution, class appropriation. Recatagorization of response options
was conducted when appropriate. After the removal of missing and outlier
values, a total of 416 observations and 18 variables were saved for data
exploration.

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

In this sample of smokers, a higher proportion of smokers who completed
secondary education were categorized in all three addiction levels.
Married individuals with Higher Wealth level were also categorized in
different level the highest proportion being under high addiction. In
all three categories of HSI, participants of rural residence were larger
in proportion than urban residents. All codes related to data
exploration are saved under code/analysis_code with a file name of
exploratorycodeR.R

All tables and figures listed below are saved under results folder

@table1 shows a summary of the data.

@figure1 shows boxplots

@figure2 shows histogram

## Basic statistical analysis

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","height_weight_stratified.png"))
```

## Full analysis

*Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to
analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This
might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R
scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce
figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you
load them here.*

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

*Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means.*

## Strengths and Limitations

*Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your
analysis.*

## Conclusions

*What are the main take-home messages?*

*Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references
will automatically be placed at the end*

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses.

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers
published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in
this template.

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document,
the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the
YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are
available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location
of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference
file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib`
but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
