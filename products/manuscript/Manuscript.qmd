# Introduction

## General Background Information

For countries like Botswana, and other African countries the prevalence
of smoking is relatively low compared to other middle and high income
countries. However, while the smoking prevalence might be low, not much
has been said about smokers nicotine dependence in the region.
Understanding nicotine dependence among smokers provides an opportunity
for a targeted intervention strategies that are more efficient and
effective.

Under the Global Tobacco Surveillance system Data (GTSSData) at CDC, the
Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) is the global standard to
systematically monitor adult tobacco use and track key tobacco control
indicators. The survey is a nationally representative household survey
of adults 15 years of age or older, using a standard protocol. It is
intended to generate comparable data within and across countries. GATS
enhances countries' capacity to design, implement and evaluate tobacco
control interventions ([GATS Botswana Survey
2017](https://nccd.cdc.gov/GTSSDataSurveyResources/Ancillary/DataReports.aspx?CAID=2&Survey=4&WHORegion=3&Country=123&Site=27000)).
Using GATS protocol, a nationally representative sample of 4,643
participants was collected in Botswana in 2017 using a stratified
cluster sample design.

The aim of this paper is therefor to;

1.  Describe the prevalence of nicotine dependence in Botswana using the
    Heavy Smoking Index(HSI) by Socio-demographics and other factors

2.  Explore and Identify predictors of nicotine dependence in Botswana.

# Methods

This study will conduct a secondary data analysis using the Global Adult
Tobacco Survey (GATS) Botswana as described above. The survey data
collection was completed in 2017. The sample design is a multi-stage,
geographically clustered probability sample design to produce nationally
representative data. First, households are randomly selected, then one
individual is randomly chosen from each selected household to
participate in the survey. The random selection of households and
participants allows for an unbiased, randomly selected, and nationally
representative sample of the larger population. The cluster sampling
allows representation in gender and urbanicity. More details on the
Global Adult Tobacco Survey implementation process can be found
elsewhere ([GATS Implementation
Protocol](https://nccd.cdc.gov/GTSSDataSurveyResources/Ancillary/Documentation.aspx?SUID=4&DOCT=4)).

A total of 608 variables covering topics of socio-demographic, tobacco
smoking, smokeless tobacco, cessation both smoking and smokeless,
economics, media and knowledge, attitude and perceptions of tobacco were
collected in this survey. While the outcome measure of interest
"Nicotine dependence" is not directly collected, the measure for
nicotine dependence, also known as the Heavy Smoking Index (HSI), will
be calculated as a score using two question items from the tobacco
smoking section on the survey questionnaire ([Heaviness of Smoking Index
\| Data Share 2.0
(nih.gov)](https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/instrument/heaviness-of-smoking-index).
Based on the HSI scores, smokers will be categorized into low addiction
(score 0-2), medium addiction (score 3-4), high addiction (5-6). For
this analysis, in consultation with other literature, scores 0 to 3 are
categorized as low addiction and scores 4 to 6 are categorized as high
addiction.

## Measurements

The outcome of interest is HSI: Heavy Smoking Index. Independent
variables explored in this analysis include AGE: Current age of smokers,
A01: Gender A04:Education level, A05: Employment status, A11: Marital
Status, RESIDENCE: Residence of participants, B04: Age of smoking
initiation, D01: Smoking quit attempt, D08: Smoking intent to quit

## Data import and cleaning

An SPSS data file was [downloaded from GTSS Info
website](https://nccd.cdc.gov/GTSSDataSurveyResources/Ancillary/DataReports.aspx?CAID=2&Survey=4&WHORegion=3&Country=123&Site=27000)
and imported into R. The code for importing and cleaning the dataset is
documented in the R script file titled "processingcode.R". The raw
dataset contained 4643 observations and 608 variables, of which 591
variables were filtered out. Only 17 variables were considered for
further examination.The variables of interest included
socio-demographics, smoking status, smoking behaviors, cessation and
media exposure. The 18th variable was computed by summing two variables
(B01 + B07) to create the Heavy Smoking Index (HSI) Score, a proxy for
examining nicotine dependence. The number of observations was further
reduced by including only daily and less than daily smokers leaving a
total of 631 observations. The dataset was examined for outliers,
distribution, class appropriation. Recatagorization of response options
was conducted when appropriate. After the removal of missing and outlier
values, a total of 416 observations and 8 variables were saved for data
exploration.

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

In this sample of smokers, males with a median age of 35 years, those
with secondary education and employed and belonging to the lowest wealth
index had high nicotine addiction. There was also higher proportion of
smokers who are single, live in rural for high addiction. Interms of
behavior, more than half of those in the high addiction catagory made a
quit attempt. similarly , the majoirty of smokers had no intent to quit
within the next year . All codes related to data exploration are saved
under code/analysis_code with a file name of exploratorycodeR.R. All
tables and figures listed below are saved under results folder

@Table1_Demographics Shows the demographics of the sample population

```{r}
result_table1 <- readRDS(here("results", "Table1_Demographics.rds"))
result_table1
```

The data also shows the mean age of those with high addiction to be
lower than the mean age of those with low addiction. This is contrary to
the belief that older smokers have higher addiction when compared to
younger smokers.

@figure1 shows a boxplot showing HSI Group mean by age

```{r}
#| label: figure1
#| fig-cap: "HSI By Age."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","AgeVSHSI.png"))
```

Interms of age of smoking initiation, those in the high addiction group
have a mean age of smoking initiation slightly higher than those in the
low addicition group. This again is contrary to the literature out there
that suggests starting smoking early leads to high addiction in
adulthood.

@figure2 shows a boxplot showing HSI Group mean age of smoking
initiation

```{r}
#| label: figure2
#| fig-cap: "HSI By Age of smoking Initiation."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","BO4vsHSI.png"))
```

## Basic statistical analysis

## Full analysis

A binary 5 fold cross validation logisitc regression was performed.
Model 1 used all predictors, Model 2 used only thet age of initiation as
the predictor and model three used cessation behaviors (quit attempt and
quit intention) as predictors. The tables below represent the results
for all three models

@Model1 All predictors

```{r}
Model_Results1 <- readRDS(here("results", "model1.rds"))
Model_Results1
```

@Model2 Age of initiation as predictor

```{r}
#| label: model2
model2 <- readRDS(here("results", "model2.rds"))
model2
```

@Model3 Quit attempt and quit intent as predictors

```{r}
#| label: model1
model3 <- readRDS(here("results", "model3.rds"))
model3
```

### Model Evaluation

Model 1 ROC Curve with all predictors

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","ROC_Mod1.png"))
```

Model 2 ROC Curve with age of smoking initiation only as the predictor

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","ROC_Mod2.png"))
```

Model 3 ROC Curve with quit attempt and quit intent as predcitors

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","ROC_Mod3.png"))
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

All three models used in this anlaysis had an roc_auc estimate of less
than .5. This means all three models do not do a good job of predicting
addiction with any more accuracy than a guess with a 50/50 outcome. This
also implies further literature review is required to narrow down some
of the most notable predictors.

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses.

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers
published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in
this template.

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document,
the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the
YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are
available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location
of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference
file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib`
but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
