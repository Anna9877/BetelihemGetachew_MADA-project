# Abstract

*Introduction:* Population level nicotine dependence research is very
limited. Even more limited in low income country like Botswana.
Understanding the nicotine dependence landscape in a country with low
smoking prevalence country is important in designing an efficient
cessation service. *Methods:* This study is a secondary data analysis
utilizing data collected by Global Adult Tobacco Survey among adults.
This study examined the 1)Prevalence of nicotine dependence and 2)
Predictors of nicotine dependence. Results: In this sample of smokers,
46% were categorized with high addiction. Those who are men, completed
secondary education, are employed, and in the lowest wealth index
residing in rural areas and single marital status tend to have high
nicotine addiction. *Conclusions:* Of all the predictors considered in
this analysis, age of smoking initiation is the most significant
predictor of nicotine dependence. *Implications:* Delayed onset of
smoking initiation is associated with low nicotine dependence. Public
health interventions should be aimed ensuring countries enforce policies
that restrict smoking by age. In addition, almost half the smokers were
high nicotine dependent, given the risk factors associated with smoking,
strategies to improve access and utilization of cessations service is
imperative.

# Introduction

## General Background Information

For countries like Botswana, and other African countries the prevalence
of smoking is relatively low compared to other middle and high income
countries. However, while the smoking prevalence might be low, not much
has been said about smokers nicotine dependence in the region.
Understanding nicotine dependence among smokers provides an opportunity
for a targeted intervention strategies that are more efficient and
effective.

Under the Global Tobacco Surveillance system Data (GTSSData) at CDC, the
Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) is the global standard to
systematically monitor adult tobacco use and track key tobacco control
indicators. The survey is a nationally representative household survey
of adults 15 years of age or older, using a standard protocol. It is
intended to generate comparable data within and across countries. GATS
enhances countries' capacity to design, implement and evaluate tobacco
control interventions ([GATS Botswana Survey
2017](https://nccd.cdc.gov/GTSSDataSurveyResources/Ancillary/DataReports.aspx?CAID=2&Survey=4&WHORegion=3&Country=123&Site=27000)).
Using GATS protocol, a nationally representative sample of 4,643
participants was collected in Botswana in 2017 using a stratified
cluster sample design.

The aim of this paper is therefor to;

1.  Describe the prevalence of nicotine dependence in Botswana using the
    Heavy Smoking Index(HSI) by Socio-demographics and other factors

2.  Explore and Identify predictors of nicotine dependence in Botswana.

## Data import and cleaning

An SPSS data file was [downloaded from GTSS Info
website](https://nccd.cdc.gov/GTSSDataSurveyResources/Ancillary/DataReports.aspx?CAID=2&Survey=4&WHORegion=3&Country=123&Site=27000)
and imported into R. The code for importing and cleaning the dataset is
documented in the R script file titled "processingcode.R". The dataset
was examined for outliers, distribution, class appropriation.
Re-catagorization of response options was conducted when appropriate.

## Methods

### Study Sample Design

This study will conduct a secondary data analysis using the Global Adult
Tobacco Survey (GATS) Botswana as described above. The GATS survey data
collection was completed in 2017. The sample design is a multi-stage,
geographically clustered probability sample design to produce nationally
representative data. First, households are randomly selected, then one
individual is randomly chosen from each selected household to
participate in the survey. The random selection of households and
participants allows for an unbiased, randomly selected, and nationally
representative sample of the larger population. The cluster sampling
allows representation in gender and urbanicity. More details on the
Global Adult Tobacco Survey implementation process can be found
elsewhere ([GATS Implementation
Protocol](https://nccd.cdc.gov/GTSSDataSurveyResources/Ancillary/Documentation.aspx?SUID=4&DOCT=4)).

### Participants

A total of 4,643 individuals completed the GAT's survey. Given the aims
of this study, examining nicotine addiction prevalence, non-smokers
(n=4012) were removed from this data analysis. A total of 631
observations of daily and non daily smokers were retained for anlaysis.
During data cleaning, 215 observations were deemed unusable data due to
missing or incorrect entries and thus further removed leaving a final
study sample of 416 observations.

### Measurement

A total of 608 variables covering topics of socio-demographic, tobacco
smoking, smokeless tobacco, cessation both smoking and smokeless,
economics, media and knowledge, attitude and perceptions of tobacco were
collected in this survey. Inline with the study objectives, 591
variables were filtered out and only 17 variables related to the study
objectives were considered for further examination. The 18th variable
was computed as a score by summing two variables (B01 Do you currently
smoke daily/less than daily or not at all + B07 How soon after you wake
up do you usually have your first smoke ) from the tobacco smoking
section of the survey to create the Heavy Smoking Index (HSI) Score, a
proxy for examining nicotine dependence ([Heaviness of Smoking Index \|
Data Share 2.0
(nih.gov)](https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/instrument/heaviness-of-smoking-index).
Based on the HSI scores, smokers were categorized into low addiction
(score 0-3), medium addiction (score 3-4), high addiction (5-6). For
this analysis, in consultation with other literature, a cut off score of
4 was deemed suitable to catagorize into low/high nicotine addiction.
Thus scores 0 to 3 are categorized as low nicotine addiction and scores
4 to 6 are categorized as high nicotine addiction [Heaviness of Smoking
Index versus Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence among Current
Smokers of Ahmedabad City,
India](https://doi.org/10.22122%2Fahj.v13i1.291).

The outcome of interest therefor for this study is HSI: Heavy Smoking
Index. While the Independent variables explored in this analysis include
AGE: Current age of smokers, A01: Gender A04:Education level, A05:
Employment status, A11: Marital Status, RESIDENCE: Residence of
participants, B04: Age of smoking initiation, D01: Smoking quit attempt,
D08: Smoking intent to quit.

# Results

## Descriptive analysis

In this sample of smokers, males with a median age of 35 years, those
with secondary education and employed and belonging to the lowest wealth
index had high nicotine addiction. There was also higher proportion of
smokers who are single, live in rural for high addiction. Interms of
behavior, more than half of those in the high addiction catagory made a
quit attempt. However , the majority of smokers had no intention to quit
within the next year . All codes related to data exploration are saved
under code/analysis_code with a file name of exploratorycodeR.R. All
tables and figures listed below are saved under results folder

@Table1_Demographics Shows the demographics of the sample population

```{r,echo=FALSE}
result_table1 <- readRDS(here("results", "Table1_Demographics.rds"))
result_table1
```

The data also shows the mean age of those with high addiction to be
lower than the mean age of those with low addiction. This is contrary to
the belief that older smokers have higher addiction when compared to
younger smokers.

@figure1 shows a boxplot showing HSI Group mean by age

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| label: figure1
#| fig-cap: "HSI By Age."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","AgeVSHSI.png"))
```

Interms of age of smoking initiation, those in the high addiction group
have a mean age of smoking initiation slightly higher than those in the
low addiction group. This again is contrary to the literature that
suggests starting smoking early leads to high addiction in adulthood.

@figure2 shows a boxplot showing HSI Group mean age of smoking
initiation

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| label: figure2
#| fig-cap: "HSI By Age of smoking Initiation."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","BO4vsHSI.png"))
```

## Basic statistical analysis

## Full analysis

A binary 5-fold cross validation logistic regression was performed.
Model I used all predictors, Model II used only the age of initiation as
the predictor and model III used cessation behaviors (quit attempt ) as
predictors. The tables below represent the results for all three models

@Model1 All predictors

```{r,echo=FALSE}
Model1 <- readRDS(here("results", "modelfit1.rds"))
Model1
```

@Model2 Age of initiation as predictor

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| label: model2
model2 <- readRDS(here("results", "modelfit2.rds"))
model2
```

@Model3 Quit attempt as predictors

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| label: model3
model3 <- readRDS(here("results", "modelfit3.rds"))
model3
```

### Model Evaluation and Performance using CV folds

The three models were evaluated based on accuracy and roc_auc scores.
Compared to model I and model III, model II performed better and thus
selected for final test fit. The metrics for all three model evaluations
considered are presented below.

Model I Performance

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| label: model1_performance
readRDS(here("results", "model1performance.rds"))

```

Model II Performance

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| label: model2_performance
 readRDS(here("results", "model2performance.rds"))

```

Model III performance

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| label: model3_performance
 readRDS(here("results", "model3performance.rds"))

```

### Final Model 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| label: figure3
#| fig-cap: "Predictive Model"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","ROC_Mod2.png"))
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

All three models used in this anlaysis had an roc_auc estimate of .59 or
less. This means these models do not do a good job of predicting
addiction with any more accuracy than a guess with a 50/50 outcome
except for model II. This also implies further literature review is
required to narrow down some of the most notable predictors. Based on
this analysis , age of smoking initiation is a statistically significant
predictor of nicotine dependence.

## Strengths and Limitations

*Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your
analysis.*

## Conclusions

Of all the predictors considered in this analysis, age of smoking
initiation is the most significant predictor of nicotine dependence.
*Implications:* Delayed onset of smoking initiation is associated with
low nicotine dependence. Public health interventions should be aimed
ensuring countries enforce policies that restrict smoking by age. In
addition, almost half the smokers were high nicotine dependent, given
the risk factors associated with smoking, strategies to improve access
and utilization of cessations service is imperative.
